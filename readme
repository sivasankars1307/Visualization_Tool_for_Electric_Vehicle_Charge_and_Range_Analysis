Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis
The Electric Vehicle (EV) is not new, but it has been receiving significantly more attention in recent years. Advances in both EV analytics and battery technologies have led to increased automotive market share. However, this growth is not attributed to hardware alone. The modern mechatronic vehicle marries electrical storage and propulsion systems with electronic sensors, controls, and actuators, integrated closely with software, secure data transfer, and data analysis, to form a comprehensive transportation solution. Advances in all these areas have contributed to the overall rise of EV’s, but the common thread that runs through all these elements is data analytics.
